# Machine Learning for Networking

This repository contains exercises, resources, and information for learning machine learning concepts and applying them to networking. 

A general structure for a short course on this material is as follows. Each lecture has (1) a set of slides explaining concepts, (2) an accompanying Jupyter Notebook with example applications from networking to make the concepts more concrete and further expand on networking concepts, (3) some basic background reading on the topic.

| Lecture | Topic                 | Slides | Notebook | Reading |
|---------|-----------------------|--------|----------|---------|
| 1       | Networking Basics     |        |          |         |
| 2       | Linear Regression     |        |          |         |
| 3       | Logistic Regression   |        |          |         |
| 4       | Naive Bayes           |        |          |         |
| 5       | Nearest Neighbor      |        |          |         |
| 6       | Unsupervised Learning |        |          |         |
| 7       | Deep Learning         |        |          |         |
| 8       | Open Problems         |        |          |         |

Please come to class having done the reading. Each class with also have a short homework assignment and a short accompanying quiz to track your knowledge of the material.

The repository has the following organization:

* example_pcaps/ - example packet captures used in notebooks
* data/ - other data used in notebooks (non-pcap)
* lectures/ - slides for each lecture
* notebooks/ - notebooks for each lecture
* reading/ - reading for lectures, as applicable
