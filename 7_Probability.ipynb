    "# Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we're going to explore probability. The concept of probability is a powerful tool that lets us answer interesting questions about our data, and it serves as the foundation of a commonly used machine learning technique for classification We'll also be building a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch, so you'll get hands-on experience coding a machine learning classifier from scratch!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with some simple probability examples on the board. Let's see how much you can recall from lecture!\n",
    "\n",
    "Say I have a bucket with 10 blue balls and 20 red balls. If I choose a ball at random from the bucket, what is the probability that I choose a red ball? That is, we want to calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P($red ball$)\\ =\\ ??$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equal to the fraction of red balls over the total number of balls.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P($red ball$)\\ =\\ \\frac{\\text{# of red balls}}{\\text{# of total balls}}\\ =\\ \\frac{20}{30}\\ =\\ \\frac{2}{3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the chance of picking a blue ball is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P($red ball$)\\ =\\ \\frac{\\text{# of blue balls}}{\\text{# of total balls}}\\ =\\ \\frac{10}{30}\\ =\\ \\frac{1}{3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say we want to find the probability of picking a red ball out of the bucket, **AND THEN** picking a blue ball out of the bucket. When we want to find the probability of two events both occurring, we multiply their probabilities together. The resulting probability is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(\\text{red ball})*P(\\text{blue ball}\\ |\\ \\text{red ball missing})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we introduce the concept of conditional probability. $P(\\text{blue ball}\\ |\\ \\text{red ball missing})$ represents the probability that a blue ball is pulled from the bucket, **given** that a red ball has already been taken out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are these two events independent? Does pulling a red ball affect the result of the probability of pulling a red ball followed by a blue ball? If it had no effect, the overall probability would be equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(\\text{red ball})*P(\\text{blue ball})$\n",
    "\n",
    "But it's not! By removing a red ball, there are now fewer overall balls to choose from, which changes the resulting probability. The full probability is therefore calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(\\text{red ball})*P(\\text{blue ball}\\ |\\ \\text{red ball missing})\\ =\\ \\frac{20}{30}*\\frac{10}{29}\\ =\\ \\frac{20}{87}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've had a chance to review, let's dive into the data."

    "Let's compute the probability that a packet from our capture was a TCP packet:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(\\text{TCP Packet})$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by loading some captured data into Python, and filtering out packets that don't have a DNS query field or a DNS response field. You'll need to fill in the blanks with the correct information. For tcp_packets, there are three options for each blank: \"data\", \"protocol\", or \"TCP\". Consult yesterday's lab if you need!"
