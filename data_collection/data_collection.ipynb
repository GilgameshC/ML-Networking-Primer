Both AI and IoT are rapidly growing and changing technologies with implications for privacy, energy use, and security (digital and physical). We'll do hands-on experiments with IoT devices, collect data from our own web browsing, and see how AI poses both risks and benefits for everyone who uses the Internet. "
