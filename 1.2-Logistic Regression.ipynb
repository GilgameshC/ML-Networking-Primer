    "Logistic Regression is very similar to linear regression, except all of the points can only have $y$-values of $1$ or $0$. This is useful if we want to predict whether something is or isn't part of a particular class. Instead of fitting a line (as in linear regression), logistic regression involves fitting a probability curve.\n",
